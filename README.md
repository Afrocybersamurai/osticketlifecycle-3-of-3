<h2>Lifecycle Stages</h2>

<p> 

<p>




<h2>Stage 1: Intake</h2>
<p> 
Go to portal, sign in and open a new ticket as a customer. For testing purposes the url is: [osTicket Link](http://localhost/osTicket/)

This stage is when a new ticket is created. 
  
Two common ways in which tickets can be submitted is through a form ‚Äì such as the one shown here ‚Äì or by emailing an email address that is designated for tickets. In this form, the user/customer provides their contact information, the topic/issue, and details about the issue.

</p>

<h2>Stage 3: Working the Issue</h2>
<p> 
Now that the ticket has been assigned to the appropriate department and people, the IT staff can work on finding a solution to the issue. Each time a change is made to the ticket or there is an update to the situation, a comment can be made in the Ticket Thread. This allows everyone viewing the ticket to be aware of what has already done and facilitates communication between everyone involved.

</p>


</p>
<h2>Stage 4: Resolution</h2>
<p> 
When the issue has been resolved, the ticket can be closed. Now the ticket will move from the Open section to the Closed section. As an IT professionals, it is a good pratice to browse closed tickets since they can be a "big library"  to find solutions to open tickets.
